Hello - this is a summary of how 'we'communicate with the web and interface using our computers. 
I call this process the communicaiton highway given the integreated, interconnected nature of the web.

The most crucial learning for me was having an understanding and appreciation for the pieces to the puzzle that make everything work. 

Here is a list:

-> Wifi
-> Router
-> Modem
-> Pipe (Hard line)
-> Servers
-> DNS Server/ IP Address
-> Content delievery network 

Given the number of varibles that go into interfacing with a website, it's clear that many things can go wrong.
One such example is I/O limited, or the existance of a bandwith issue.
Another is CPU limited, or existance for a processor limitation
Another is storage limited, or existance of hard drive space issue
-> This is less likely to occure given how large hard drives have become
