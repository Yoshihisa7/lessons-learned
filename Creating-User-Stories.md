What follows below is the Connextra Format for creating user stories

User Stories have three componenets:

1. As a ROLE -> What types/activities of users are we expecting? Are they visitors, returning customers, competitors, administrators?

2. I want a FEATURE -> Examples include shopping cart, Product reviews

3. So that BENEFIT -> The value to the specific rols mentioned above E.g. Certainty, Comfort, Real-time information

N.B. There is danger that one can fall into a "justification and overeach" trap, whereby resources are wasted building out features with a high opportunity cost and not as much benefit
