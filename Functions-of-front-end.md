Front-end is the interface between users and back-end.
Major front-end programming languages are:
 -HTML which puts wordings on the webpage;
 -CSS which customizes fonts and color; and
 -JAVA which provides movement on the website.
 User experience and user interface which matters for recent web services can be provided mainly through how you structure front-end programming.
